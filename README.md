# Job-Searcher: Python web-scraping script to find jobs
## Overview
- This was just a small little script I did to improve my web-scraping skills.

- This repo contains a simple python script used to scrape pages on Indeed in order to find recent job listings. When running the script, simply type in the desired job and zip code. Afterwards, a list of nearby jobs will show up and allow you to get more info on a selected job. Finally, the script gives a link to the original Indeed post so that the user can apply to said job.
